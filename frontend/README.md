HandsFree Type is a Chrome extension that allows you to use your voice to type on any website. It uses OpenAI's powerful speech-to-text models to provide fast and accurate dictation.

* **Simple to use**: Just press **Alt+Shift+D** to start and stop dictating.
* **Automatic language detection**: The extension automatically detects the language you're speaking.

## How to Use

1.  **Install the extension** from the Chrome Web Store.
2.  **Sign in** with your Google account.

## Privacy

Your privacy is important. HandsFree Type records audio only when you activate it. The audio is sent to a secure backend for transcription and is not stored after the transcription is complete. The extension does not collect any personal information other than what is necessary for authentication and billing.
